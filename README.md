This is an implementation of a dense tracker, using 2 images and a depth image (rgbd) for the first one.

It aims at finding the correct Rotation and Translation between 2 successive frames.

This work is a somewhat naive implementation inspired and derived from these work :

Real-Time Visual Odometry from Dense RGB-D Images
Robust Odometry Estimation for RGB-D Cameras
